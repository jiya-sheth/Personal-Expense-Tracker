A simple yet powerful Personal Expense Tracker built in Python.  
It supports both Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI), uses SQLite for local storage, and includes a budget warning system to help you track and manage your expenses effectively.

# Tech Stack
- Python 3.8+
- SQLite (lightweight database, file-based)
- Tkinter (ttk) for GUI
- CSV export


I went ahead and checked the local setup of environment in vs code.
I created new file for the personal expense tracker.
Now, the basic ideas were to create an expense tracker with a UI so I implemented tkinter for GUI and CLI is already available. 
Then with help of AI tools nd some brainstorming, i created a very basic model of expense tracker.
Then after using it for a day or so, it hit me that this could also have an additional feature of budget limit. So i started working on the same.
However i faced errors when i tried to merge the budget limit code to the original code. But with the help of AI i was able to figure out where i was going wrong. 
After this, the CLI would print a warning and the GUI would display a popup.
I tested and ran it for the final time.
Eventually the model was ready and i finally pushed it to GitHub
